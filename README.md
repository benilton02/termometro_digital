##  Digital Thermometer

> Develop a prototype of a Digital Thermometer using Arduino and its accessories. According to the necessary requirements.

##  Requirements

> 1. It Must contain a temperature sensor **(DHT-11)**;
>
> 2. It must contain a **LCD Display**, or similar, to indicate the temperature with two floating point, showing maximum and minimum Temperature on display;
>
> 3. It activate a siren out of the working range **(MIN = 25,2°C e MAX = 32,6°C)**;
>
> 4. It should be easy to move and install, i.e., small, lightweight, portable and DC-powered;
>
> 5. It must have a structure made of plastic, wood, or any other kind of material;
